  <h2>What is Zirka?</h2>
  <article>
    <p><strong>Have you ever wanted a fantasy/rune/sci-fi/glyph language to use in your game/story/everyday life/whatever?</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Zirka</strong> is a right-to-left written and spoken language that originates as an English codex but utilizes the grammar rules of several
      other languages in addition to its own alphabet and pronunciations in order to give it its own unique feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be used in many different ways under its <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative
      Commons BY-NC-ND 4.0</a> license, and its rune-like characters make it usable in a variety of different settings! Fantasy
      worlds, alien civilizations, ancient technology... Anything you need! With minimal tweaks, you can even use the Zirka for
      multiple purposes in your worlds!
    </p>

    <h3>Tell me More!</h3>
    <p><a href="https://robbie.antenesse.net" title="Robbie Antenesse's Website" target="_blank">Robbie Antenesse</a> has been
      developing Zirka on and off since October 2004! Originally just an English alphabet mask for a map he made
      when he was little, Robbie has borrowed from several other languages and developed simple grammar rules that have
      turned Zirka into a full-blown language all its own. It&rsquo;s an approximate language at best, but that makes it perfect
      for runic or ancient inscriptions as well as cryptic alien messages. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t also make full
      pages of text in Zirka to also make an entire library worth of text! The best part about Zirka is that it&rsquo;s not
      <em>just</em> a written languageâ€”you can read it aloud, too! It&rsquo;s intended to be mysterious but be translatable, to
      look cool but be pronounceable.</p>
    <p>The Zirka language utilizes rules and pronunciations from all of the following languages to bring everything
      together:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>English</li>
      <li>Spanish/Latin</li>
      <li>Hebrew</li>
      <li>Thai</li>
      <li>Gibberish</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align:center;margin:10px 0 30px;">

    <p>If you are interested in using Zirka in your own website, we have developed a small JavaScript plugin that will
      convert properly-prepared English characters into Zirka characters in whatever size you might need. Check out the
      <a href="https://github.com/Alamantus/Zirka-Assets/#zirka-translator">GitHub</a> page to learn how to install it, or
      check out the <a href="./demo.html" target="_blank">demo page</a> to play around with it first!</p>
    <p>If you want to use the Zirka language for any commercial purpose (i.e. if whatever you are using it for will make
      money), contact Robbie Antenesse at dev@alamantus.com to discuss free commercial licenses.</p>
    <p>Also, if you&rsquo;d like to buy Robbie a cup of coffee for the language, tutorials, and any future things that are
      coming, we&rsquo;ll happily accept your <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/robbieantenesse"
        title="Buy Me A Coffee" target="_blank">donation through BuyMeACoffee</a> and thank you publicly if you give a
      name or alias!</p>
